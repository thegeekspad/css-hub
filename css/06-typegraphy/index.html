        <h2>CSS Fact</h2>
        <p>
          The world's first website was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, and
          it used a very basic form of CSS to apply styles. However, this early
          version of CSS was quite limited compared to what we have today. It
          allowed for simple styling like changing text colors and fonts, but it
          couldn't do many of the complex layout and design tasks that modern
          CSS can handle. Over the years, CSS has evolved significantly to
          become a powerful tool for web designers and developers, enabling them
          to create visually stunning and responsive websites.
