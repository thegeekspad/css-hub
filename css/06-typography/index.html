        <h2>CSS Fact</h2>
        <p>
          The world's <span class="upper">first</span> website was created by
          <span class="underline">Tim Berners-Lee</span> in 1990, and it used a
          very basic form of CSS to apply styles. However, this early version of
          CSS was quite limited compared to what we have today. It allowed for
          simple styling like changing text colors and fonts, but it couldn't do
          many of the complex layout and design tasks that modern CSS can
          handle. Over the years, CSS has evolved significantly to become a
          powerful tool for web designers and developers, enabling them to
          create visually stunning and responsive websites.
